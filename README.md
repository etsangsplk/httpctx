## Deprecated
Go 1.7 includes the `context` package in the standard library, and the `net/http` package includes a  `Context` in the `http.Request` structure. If you are targeting Go 1.7 and later, there is significantly less need for a package like `httpctx`.

## Description
The `httpctx` package provides a convenient way to handle HTTP requests
using "context-aware" handler functions. Context-aware handlers
are different from the standard `http.Handler` in two important ways:

1. They accept an additional parameter of the (almost) standard type `context.Context`
(golang.org/x/net/context); and
2. They return an error result.

The `httpctx` package also implements a simple middleware chaining mechanism. The idea
for this comes from Justinas Stankeviƒçius and his `alice` package. (https://github.com/justinas/alice).

For usage examples, refer to the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/spkg/httpctx) documentation.
